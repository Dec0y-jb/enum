# Dependencies
In order to use enum, you will need to install the following:

- https://github.com/OWASP/Amass
- https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns
- https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r
- https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

Once these are installed (or if they are already installed), you will need to modify the path variables in 'enum.sh':
```
# path definitions
masspath=~/massdns
sublisterpath=~/tools/Sublist3r
seclistspath=~/SecLists
amasspath=~/amass_v3.0.27_linux_amd64
```
